==== Nuova qbHand (18/01/2018) ====
1. Follow this guide to install the command line utility: 
	https://bitbucket.org/qbrobotics/qbdevice-api

2. >> cd Desktop/mp_workingcopy/qbadmin/bin_unix

3. >> ./qbadmin -t
	output: Choose the serial port for your QB:

		[1] - /dev/ttyUSB0

		Serial port: 1

4. >> ./qbadmin -p
	it should output the parameters of the hand

5. Set the zero position:
   >> ./qbadmin 1 -z
	output: Press CTRL-C to set Zero Position

		Press return to proceed
	5.1. press return
	5.2. completely open the hand manually
	5.3. press Ctrl+C
	     output: Setting zero position


6. >> ./qbadmin -p
	Check the ID of the hand (that must be written in the configuration file 
	/home/sirslab/ros_ws/src/qb_interface_node/conf/config.yaml) and the control mode.
	If the control mode is not "Current" do:
	6.1. >> ./qbparam
	6.2. setParam (press "s")
	6.3. set control mode to be "current" (don't worry too much if a segmentation fault occurs)
	6.4. do again >> ./qbadmin -p and check that the control mode is current


==== ROS package for force control (usare questo)
1. Download ros package from https://github.com/SIRSIIT/qb_interface_node
2. Copy it in the ROS workspace and do catkin_make
3. Terminal 1: >> roscore
4. Terminal 2: 
	4.1. Load the configuration file:
		>> rosparam load $(rospack find qb_interface)/conf/config.yaml
	4.2. Start the ros node:
		>> rosrun qb_interface qb_force_control
		output: Unable to retrieve hand params. ID: 2
			[INFO] Start to spin qb_interface_node
5. Terminal 3 (set position): >> rostopic pub /qb_class/hand_ref qb_interface/handRef "closure: [9000]"
	N.B. The grasp closure is within [0-19000] (0 open, 19000 (or more) closed)
6. Terminal 4 (set stiffness): >> rosparam set /stiffness 0.1
	N.B. Stiffness is within [0-1.0]
    
Possible error: "[ERROR] Connection error in spin() function."
Solution:
>> cd Desktop/mp_workingcopy/qbadmin/bin_unix

3. >> ./qbadmin -t
	output: Choose the serial port for your QB:

		[1] - /dev/ttyUSB0

		Serial port: 1

4. >> ./qbadmin -p
	it should output the parameters of the hand - check if it's /dev/ttyUSB0 or /dev/ttyUSB1 and put this info 
    in the config file of the hand by doing: 
    
5.  >> nano $(rospack find qb_interface)/conf/config.yaml

================================= Spiegazione di Joao
so you set a certain stiffness, say 0.5
and you set a position, say 10000
and let's say the hand is open at 0
so it will start by giving a current of 
cur=0.5*(10000-0) = 5000A (which saturates)
and then it starts closing on an object and grasps it when the encoder is at 8000
so now it will keep gripping with motor current of:
cur=0.5*(10000-8000)=1000mA
so then you can grip it tighter by either setting a larger position or increasing the stiffness...
say you set stiffness to 0.6, now the new current will be 1200mA
so it's k*(x_ref-x_now)
I gave this to virginia now, because I think they should work on this, not me
to add also some feedforward current that will depend on the elasticity of the hand, on the friction, etc.
so in the end we should have something like:
current=k(x_ref-x_now)+feedfwd(x,x')

=================================  
Install qbadmin and qbAPI 29/05/2018
=================================


1 - create directory in Desktop called 'my_working_copy'
2 - Download and open here https://bitbucket.org/qbrobotics/qbdevice-api/downloads/
3 - rename the folder as qbAPI
4 - Download and open here https://bitbucket.org/qbrobotics/qbdevice-admin/downloads/
5 - rename the folder as qbadmin

in order to compile API open a terminal and type:
1 - cd ~/Desktop/my_working_copy/qbAPI/src
2 - make

in order to compile admin tools open a terminali and type:
1 - cd ~/Desktop/my_working_copy/qbadmin/src
2 - make

the executable needed for managing the softhand is in 
1 - cd ~/Desktop/my_working_copy/qbadmin/bin_unix

add the user to the group 'dialout', type in the terminal 
sudo adduser 'user' dialout //substitute 'user' with the name of the current computer user.

reboot the computer

try the qbadmintools, open a terminal and type:
1 - cd ~/Desktop/my_working_copy/qbadmin/bin_unix
2 - ./qbadmin -p //to show details about all the interfaces connected

have fun!
