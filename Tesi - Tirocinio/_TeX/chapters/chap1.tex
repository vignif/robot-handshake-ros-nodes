%This project applies learning \cite{knoop2017handshakiness} techniques to MNIST handwritten dataset. As we can see in the previous confusion matrix the accuracy of the final work is $97.6\%$. The overall idea is to train \emph{autoenc1},  \emph{autoenc2} and \emph{softmax1} once per time and to crop the nets in order to have coherents dimension between network interconnections. At the end of \cite{catalanopisa}this process we stack all the partial neural network together and the deep neural network come to life. \\The satisfaction behind this project can be experimented by running the file "MNIST\textunderscore drawsim.m" which is a matlab function that allows the user to draw a digit and returns the correct digit value 97,6 times over 100.
