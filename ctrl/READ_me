for running experiments with the 5 different proposed controllers


START
assign to the participant an ID in an increasing fashion
find q0 per each participant and map the handsize code (from 1 to 5) for running all the experiment

q0	|	handsize code
8500	|	1
9000	|	2
10000	|	3
11000	|	4
12000	|	5


delay 
rosparam set /delay 0,125


I also have per each participants, and per each experiment a csv file with acquired columns [FSR1, FSR2, FSR3, q_ref, q].
to notice only FSR1 and FSR2 are taken in consideration for computing the grasping force of the Pisa/IIT SoftHand. the files has a row of zeros to highlight a new handshake of the same participants.
